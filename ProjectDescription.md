# Fraud-Detection
This project is based on predicting whether a given credit card transaction is a Normal Transaction or a Fradualent Transaction .

Data Set used is a real world data set that is obtained from Kaggle.com. Data Set is a highly imbalanced in nature hence a simple undersampling technique is used to make the data set balanced.

I interpreted the given Business Problem as a classification machine learning problem and hence a classification Machine Learning Algorithm ( Logistic Regression) is used .
At the End I also made a GUI where a user can input values for the fields of a particular transaction and when the user click on predict Button the model will tell whether the given transaction is normal or Fradualent .
